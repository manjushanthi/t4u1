 *                    to change rows would edit the cell above rather than the cell below
 *                    the cell being edited.

 * Renderers - A collection of useful renderers that are used to owner draw a cell in an ObjectListView
 *
 * Author: Phillip Piper
 * Date: 27/09/2008 9:15 AM
 *
 * Change log: 
 * 2013-04-29   JPP  - Fixed bug where Images were not vertically aligned
 * v2.6
 * 2012-10-26   JPP  - Hit detection will no longer report check box hits on columns without checkboxes.
 * 2012-07-13   JPP  - [Breaking change] Added preferedSize parameter to IRenderer.GetEditRectangle().
 * v2.5.1
 * 2012-07-14   JPP  - Added CellPadding to various places. Replaced DescribedTaskRenderer.CellPadding.
 * 2012-07-11   JPP  - Added CellVerticalAlignment to various places allow cell contents to be vertically
 *                     aligned (rather than always being centered).
 * v2.5
 * 2010-08-24   JPP  - CheckBoxRenderer handles hot boxes and correctly vertically centers the box.
 * 2010-06-23   JPP  - Major rework of HighlightTextRenderer. Now uses TextMatchFilter directly.
 *                     Draw highlighting underneath text to improve legibility. Works with new
 *                     TextMatchFilter capabilities.
 * v2.4
 * 2009-10-30   JPP  - Plugged possible resource leak by using using() with CreateGraphics()
 * v2.3
 * 2009-09-28   JPP  - Added DescribedTaskRenderer
 * 2009-09-01   JPP  - Correctly handle an ImageRenderer's handling of an aspect that holds
 *                     the image to be displayed at Byte[].
 * 2009-08-29   JPP  - Fixed bug where some of a cell's background was not erased. 
 * 2009-08-15   JPP  - Correctly MeasureText() using the appropriate graphic context
 *                   - Handle translucent selection setting
 * v2.2.1
 * 2009-07-24   JPP  - Try to honour CanWrap setting when GDI rendering text.
 * 2009-07-11   JPP  - Correctly calculate edit rectangle for subitems of a tree view
 *                     (previously subitems were indented in the same way as the primary column)
 * v2.2
 * 2009-06-06   JPP  - Tweaked text rendering so that column 0 isn't ellipsed unnecessarily.
 * 2009-05-05   JPP  - Added Unfocused foreground and background colors 
 *                     (thanks to Christophe Hosten)
 * 2009-04-21   JPP  - Fixed off-by-1 error when calculating text widths. This caused
 *                     middle and right aligned columns to always wrap one character
 *                     when printed using ListViewPrinter (SF#2776634).
 * 2009-04-11   JPP  - Correctly renderer checkboxes when RowHeight is non-standard
 * 2009-04-06   JPP  - Allow for item indent when calculating edit rectangle
 * v2.1
 * 2009-02-24   JPP  - Work properly with ListViewPrinter again
 * 2009-01-26   JPP  - AUSTRALIA DAY (why aren't I on holidays!)
 *                   - Major overhaul of renderers. Now uses IRenderer interface.
 *                   - ImagesRenderer and FlagsRenderer<T> are now defunct.
 *                     The names are retained for backward compatibility.
 * 2009-01-23   JPP  - Align bitmap AND text according to column alignment (previously
 *                     only text was aligned and bitmap was always to the left).
 * 2009-01-21   JPP  - Changed to use TextRenderer rather than native GDI routines.
 * 2009-01-20   JPP  - Draw images directly from image list if possible. 30% faster!
 *                   - Tweaked some spacings to look more like native ListView
 *                   - Text highlight for non FullRowSelect is now the right color
 *                     when the control doesn't have focus.
 *                   - Commented out experimental animations. Still needs work.
 * 2009-01-19   JPP  - Changed to draw text using GDI routines. Looks more like
 *                     native control this way. Set UseGdiTextRendering to false to 
 *                     revert to previous behavior.
 * 2009-01-15   JPP  - Draw background correctly when control is disabled
 *                   - Render checkboxes using CheckBoxRenderer
 * v2.0.1
 * 2008-12-29   JPP  - Render text correctly when HideSelection is true.
 * 2008-12-26   JPP  - BaseRenderer now works correctly in all Views
 * 2008-12-23   JPP  - Fixed two small bugs in BarRenderer
 * v2.0
 * 2008-10-26   JPP  - Don't owner draw when in Design mode
 * 2008-09-27   JPP  - Separated from ObjectListView.cs
