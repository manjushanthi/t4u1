Interfaces have been used as a means of factoring processing for cross platform development.
T4U was initially proposed to be cross platform.
The structure has been designed so when processing could be performed on an object based upon an interface, 
which is platform independent that processing was transferred to the Domain or Data.Shared project.
Halfway through an IOS demonstration was created and tested using this approach.
Since then a decision was made that T4U should be a windows application only. This explains that in the 
latter part of development this methodology has been less rigorously followed.
Should cross platform become a requirement, refactoring should be performed.
